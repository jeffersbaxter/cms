                I have become a hockey fan because of the Kraken. My enthusiasm for the product, in concert with my enthusiasm for software development, inspired me to develop an application using the stack listed on a developer job posting with the team.

                This is project was my first exposure to NextJS, Amplify, Graphql and Tailwind. I developed and deployed this application in a matter of days - demonstrating my ability to adapt and learn new skills.
